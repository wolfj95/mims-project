# Project
For this project, students should use the Python Turtle to create an animation in the
`project.ipynb` notebook. This animation should combine functions which draw static shapes
(defined in the `parts.py` module). Additionally, there are functions and context managers
to help create the animation in the `helpers.py` module.
